# PHP Style Guide

This is a style guide for PHP, which should be used when contributing to
one of my [projects][]. It accumulates most of the practices I've
developed over the last few months.

It's very much inspired by the [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide),
and [Github's Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby).

You may use this style guide for yourself too and it's meant to be
forked.

If you've questions or want to discuss: open an issue in the [issue
tracker](/CHH/php-styleguide/issues) or direct your tweets at
[`@hochchristoph`](http://twitter.com/hochchristoph).
