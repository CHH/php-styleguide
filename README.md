# PHP Style Guide

This is a style guide for PHP, which should be used when contributing to
one of my [projects][].

It's very much inspired by the [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide),
and [Github's Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby).

You may use this style guide for yourself too and it's meant to be
forked.
